/// The default channel search order is stable, beta, dev, and canary.
/// When there is an override WEBVIEW2_RELEASE_CHANNEL_PREFERENCE environment
/// variable or applicable releaseChannelPreference registry value
/// with the value of 1, the channel search order is reversed.

/// userDataFolder can be

/// WebView2 creation can fail if the executable is running in a directory
/// that the process doesn't have permission to create a new folder in.

///
/// - `{app_name}` is the host application exe filename, e.g. WebView2Example.exe
/// - `{pipe_name}` is the value set for WEBVIEW2_PIPE_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER.

/// where:
///
/// - `{port_num}` is the port on which the CDP server will bind.
///
/// Be aware that setting both the WEBVIEW2_PIPE_FOR_SCRIPT_DEBUGGER and

    ///`applyHostFunction`, `getHostProperty`, `setHostProperty` | Perform a method invocation, property get, or property set on the host object. Use the methods to explicitly force a method or property to run remotely if a conflicting local method or property exists.  For instance, `proxy.toString()` runs the local `toString` method on the proxy object. But proxy.applyHostFunction('toString') runs `toString` on the host proxied object instead.
    ///`getLocalProperty`, `setLocalProperty` | Perform property get, or property set locally.  Use the methods to force getting or setting a property on the host object proxy rather than on the host object it represents. For instance, `proxy.unknownProperty` gets the property named `unknownProperty` from the host proxied object.  But proxy.getLocalProperty('unknownProperty') gets the value of the property `unknownProperty` on the proxy object.
    ///`sync` | Asynchronous host object proxies expose a sync method which returns a promise for a synchronous host object proxy for the same host object.  For example, `chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall()` returns an asynchronous host object proxy.  Use the `sync` method to obtain a synchronous host object proxy instead: `const syncProxy = await chrome.webview.hostObjects.sample.methodCall().sync()`.
    ///`async` | Synchronous host object proxies expose an async method which blocks and returns an asynchronous host object proxy for the same host object.  For example, `chrome.webview.hostObjects.sync.sample.methodCall()` returns a synchronous host object proxy.  Running the `async` method on this blocks and then returns an asynchronous host object proxy for the same host object: `const asyncProxy = chrome.webview.hostObjects.sync.sample.methodCall().async()`.
    ///`then` | Asynchronous host object proxies have a `then` method.  Allows proxies to be awaitable.  `then` returns a promise that resolves with a representation of the host object.  If the proxy represents a JavaScript literal, a copy of that is returned locally.  If the proxy represents a function, a non-awaitable proxy is returned.  If the proxy represents a JavaScript object with a mix of literal properties and function properties, the a copy of the object is returned with some properties as host object proxies.
    ///
    /// All other property and method invocations (other than the above Remote
    /// object proxy methods, `forceLocalProperties` list, and properties on
    /// Function and Object prototypes) are run remotely.  Asynchronous host
    /// object proxies return a promise representing asynchronous completion of
    /// remotely invoking the method, or getting the property.  The promise
    /// resolves after the remote operations complete and the promises resolve to
    ///  the resulting value of the operation.  Synchronous host object proxies
    /// work similarly, but block running JavaScript and wait for the remote
    /// operation to complete.
    ///
    /// Setting a property on an asynchronous host object proxy works slightly
    /// differently.  The set returns immediately and the return value is the
    /// value that is set.  This is a requirement of the JavaScript Proxy object.
    /// If you need to asynchronously wait for the property set to complete, use
    /// the `setHostProperty` method which returns a promise as described above.
    /// Synchronous object property set property synchronously blocks until the
    /// property is set.
